# Vega20-MI50-Cooling-Performance_FOX-2-Blower
Since I already did the performance per PPT test, it is really un-necessary here, the main x factor tested is that the shrouded 80mm is removed and a FOX-2 turbine is tied to the front bracket.

I think it's best we view the raw logs to get a idea of how it feels.
The logs contain edge, junction, VRAM temperatures, along with the corresponding PPT. The recordings run every 2 seconds, therefore the number on top actually shows the time elapsed if multiplied by 2.

The measurements / stress test starts with a preheated heatsink (by previous tests) with the die cooled to under 40C (stable). 
They run for two minutes, or end prematurely if anything hits crit temperatures of 92C.

FOX-2 is a PCIe blower fan that I tied to the card's reinstalled bracket.
It's specs are as follows :
- 111mm Turbine
- 2800 RPM
- 56 CFM
- 1.78 mm H2O
- 31 dB or less
